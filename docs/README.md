# AI Generation Accelerator (AIGA)

The **AI Generation Accelerator (AIGA)** provides a repeatable framework for building standardised LLM applications. It is intended to accelerate the delivery of value by:

1. Bootstrapping experimentation and evaluation
1. Implementing best practices for building and deploying Generative AI capabilities
1. Providing a pre-approved set of artefacts, processes, and tools to support industrialisation at scale

The AI Generation Accelerator (AIGA) will comprise a collection of artefacts, processes, and tools, each with a specific scope and purpose.
