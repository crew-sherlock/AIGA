# Getting Started

If you are looking to start a new Generative AI project, you should consider using the AIGA Starter. If you are looking to find out more about the benefits of using AIGA, check out the [README.md](../README.md).

This guide contains the steps to set up a new project using the AIGA Starter and explains the artefacts that are generated by the template.

## Prerequisites

Before you start working with AIGA, ensure you have:
Before you start working with AIGA, ensure you have:

| Entity  | Description |
| -------- | ---- |
| Resource Group + Service principal  | These 2 things are required for the AIGA starter to create an AIGA project from the AIGA template. |
| AIGA Users team | In order to be able to work with the AIGA Starter (i.e. trigger the Start AIGA Project Action) you would need to be in the GitHub team [AIGA Users](https://github.com/orgs/commercial-software-engineering/teams/aiga-users) that is authorised to the repository.|

## Steps to set up a new project

1. **Request to be added to the AIGA Users team**: Go to the [GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/commercial-software-engineering/teams/aiga-users) and request to be added to the team by selecting the "Request to join" button. This will allow you to trigger the "Create AIGA Project" workflow in the AIGA Starter repository.

1. **Request a new project**: Go to GitHub Actions of [AIGA-starter](https://github.com/commercial-software-engineering/AIGA-Starter) and run the "Create AIGA Project" workflow with chosen parameters (you need a service principal and a key vault). This will create a new repository and infrastructure artefacts based on the AIGA reference architecture. AIGA gets all its environment variables from the key vault.

1. **Set up your AIGA Project**: Configure your AIGA Project repository by following the instructions in the [developer guide](/docs/contributing/developer-guide.md).

1. **Customize your project**: Now you are all set to start working on your project. Once all your infrastructure is setup, you can focus on your project specificities. Check the guide on the [lifecycle of a GenAI project](/docs/design/ai-evaluation.md) to help you.

1. **Evaluate your GenAI application**: Once your repository is fully configured, you can follow the [evaluation user guide](/docs/onboarding/experiment-evaluate-locally.md) to evaluate iteratively your application and refine your flows and pipelines.

1. **Deploy your flows**: Once you are happy with your inference prompt flow's performance, you can deploy it to App Service or Azure Machine Learning (AML) endpoint using the CI/CD workflows provided in the AIGA Project repository. More information on making a decision between App Service and AML can be found in the [deployment guide](./deployment.md).

1. **Deploy your Document processing pipelines**: Once you are happy with your document processing pipelines, you can deploy it to Azure Machine Learning (AML) the CI/CD workflows provided in the AIGA Project repository (*TBD: WHEN READY*).

## The included artefacts

Once you have followed the above steps, the following artefacts will be provisioned :

- **Infrastructure artefacts based on AIGA [reference architecture](../design/reference-architecture.md)**: A set of infrastructure artefacts including architecture documentation that can be used for review board, and IaC.

Once you request a new project using the AIGA Starter, the following artefacts will be generated:

- **AIGA Project Repository**: A clone of the AIGA Template repository, which will include a document loading AML pipeline, QA generation script, example prompt flows for common use cases for inference and evaluation, tools for deploying your prompt flows (CI/CD) to App Service or Azure Machine Learning (AML) endpoint, and documentation. The pipelines and prompt flows are designed to be modular so that you can easily customise them and experiment with different configurations while also providing an end-to-end path to productionising your Gen AI project.

    The included components are:

## Personas

The following personas are involved in the AIGA project setup:

1. **Product Manager and End Users**: Use AIGA to scope and define the project objectives and success criteria, as well as requirements.

1. **Architects and Gen AI Engineer**:
Use AIGA Reference Architecture to design the product architecture and go through review board.

1. **Data Scientist, Gen AI Engineers and End Users (SME)**: Use the AIGA Project repository to experiment, build and evaluate their GenAI application and fine tune is to their expectations.

1. **Gen AI Engineer**: Use the AIGA Starter to instantiate a project repository from the AIGA Template and industrialise their Gen AI Project.

1. **Product Manager**: Use the project documentation to go through review board during industrialization and supervise MLOps gates into production.

1. **L3 Support**: Maintains the Application based on SME's feedback and migration plans.

Maintainers have full access to their repositories and are able to manage code, actions, and RBAC on their repositories. These include:

- **AIGA Maintainer**: Maintains the AIGA repository.
- **AIGA Starter Maintainer**: Maintains the AIGA-Starter repository.

> Add a maintainer to the repository by adding them to the [AIGA Collaborators list](https://github.com/commercial-software-engineering/AIGA/settings/access) or to [AIGA-Starter Collaborators list](https://github.com/commercial-software-engineering/AIGA-Starter/settings/access) with an admin role.

### Contributors

Contributors have access to their repositories and are able to contribute to the codebase and actions. These include:

- **AIGA Contributor**: Contributes to the AIGA repository.
- **AIGA Starter Contributor**: Contributes to the AIGA-Starter repository.

> Add a contributor to the repository by adding them to the [AIGA Collaborators list](https://github.com/commercial-software-engineering/AIGA/settings/access) or to [AIGA-Starter Collaborators list](https://github.com/commercial-software-engineering/AIGA-Starter/settings/access) with a write role.

### Users

Users can trigger actions and use the AIGA-Starter repository. This includes:

- **AIGA Starter User**: Triggers actions and uses the AIGA-Starter repository.

> Add an AIGA Starter User by adding them to the [AIGA-Users team](https://github.com/orgs/commercial-software-engineering/teams/aiga-users)
