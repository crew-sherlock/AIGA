# Getting Started

If you are looking to start a new Generative AI project, you should consider using the AIGA Starter. If you are looking to find out more about the benefits of using AIGA, check out the [README.md](../README.md).

This guide contains the steps to set up a new project using the AIGA Starter and explains the artefacts that are generated by the template.

## Prerequisites

Before you start your infrastructure request, ensure you have:

| Entity | System (to request) | Description | Assignment Group |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Business Application CIID | [CMDB](https://gsk.service-now.com/home?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=fb257b2b1b7a7d104ab887b8e34bcb95) | In order to create a new instance of AIGA, you need a business application CIID. This will be the umbrella for the application service CIID. | ESM-Platform-CMDB-L2 |
| Application service CIID | [CMDB](https://gsk.service-now.com/home?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=a02468771bbb31904ab887b8e34bcb3a) | For each environment, you need an instance of an application service. | ESM-Platform-CMDB-L2 |
| Resource Group + Service principal | [Hosting portal](https://myhosting.gsk.com/cloud-onboarding/azure-resource-groups/overview) | In order to have the service principal and resources associated with the project (outside the DevKit), you need to request a resource group on Azure and a service principal. This step requires an operational CIID.| |
| AD Group | [Sailpoint](https://myapps.gsk.com/identityiq/workitem/workItems.jsf#/workItems) | In order to give access to the developers access to the infrastructure, you need an AD group RW for dev. Make sure that you create a ticket to link the AD group to the RG by requesting a [Tech Service](https://servicenow.gsk.com/home?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0e6a06bcdb5ce4506233d25cd3961932) assigned to *SCDT - DA Platform Product Support Service*. In the description request *RG reader* and *Key vault contributor*| |

## The included artefacts

Once you request a new project using the AIGA Starter, the following artefacts will be generated:

- **Infrastructure artefacts based on AIGA [reference architecture](../design/reference-architecture.md)**: A set of infrastructure artefacts including architecture documentation that can be used for ARB1, pre-filled Excel infrastructure request forms, and instructions on how to fill out the GenAI Dev Kit request form.

    > *TBD: will we be able to offer samples of other necessary documentation e.g. URS, smart control assessment, accountability report?*

- **AIGA Project Repository**: A clone of the AIGA Template repository, which will include a document loading AML pipeline, QA generation script, example prompt flows for common use cases for inference and evaluation, tools for deploying your prompt flows (CI/CD) to App Service or Azure Machine Learning (AML) endpoint, and documentation. The pipelines and prompt flows are designed to be modular so that you can easily customise them and experiment with different configurations while also providing an end-to-end path to productionising your Gen AI project.

    The included components are:

We also recommend the following artefact for RAG projects that need in depth experimentation on chunking, indexing, and search strategies:

- *(Optional)* **RAG Experimentation Repository**: A clone of the RAG Experiment Accelerator repository, which includes tools for running experiments and evaluations of search queries and quality of response from OpenAI. This will help you decide on the configuration of your search index, chunking strategy, and search strategy by allowing you to test the performance of different Search and OpenAI related hyperparameters, compare the effectiveness of various search strategies. The repository will output a configuration file that can be transformed into a search index configuration file for the AIGA Project repository.

## Steps to set up a new project

1. **Request a new project**: Go to GitHub Actions of [AIGA-starter](https://github.com/gsk-tech/AIGA-Starter) and run the "Create AIGA Project" workflow with chosen parameters (e.g. project name, CIID, infrastructure configuration). This will create a new repository and infrastructure artefacts based on the AIGA reference architecture.

1. **Submit ARB1**: You will need to go through the ARB1 process to get approval for your project. You should use the reference architecture documentation generated by the AIGA Starter to help you with this process. Example AIGA ARB template including the reference architecture can be found [here](https://myteams.gsk.com/:p:/r/sites/GenAIAccelerator/Shared%20Documents/General/Architecture%20+%20Mandatory%20Documents/Architecture%20Review%20Board%20-%20Presentation%20Template%20V0.2.pptx?d=w0247cd50adb54fc2a56c3291ee60deb7&csf=1&web=1&e=aT7K0j).

1. **Submit infrastructure requests**: Verify the Excel infrastructure request forms and submit them within the GenAI Dev Kit request form and via a [Tech service request](https://servicenow.gsk.com/home?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0e6a06bcdb5ce4506233d25cd3961932) for the PSC team  assigned to *SCDT - DA Platform Product Support Service*.

1. *(Optional)* **Get started with the RAG Experimentation project**: If you are running a RAG project and need in depth experimentation on search strategies, clone the RAG Experiment Accelerator and get started following the instructions in the accelerator's README.

1. **Set up your AIGA Project**: Configure your AIGA Project repository by following the instructions in the onboarding guide (*TBD: INSERT LINK WHEN READY*). You should customise the document loading pipeline and inference and evaluation prompt flows to suit your project requirements - this includes configuring your search index, generating your golden dataset, and fine tuning your prompt within the inference flow. Find the best configuration by experimenting with different search strategies and leverage the evaluation flow to measure the performance of your configuration.

1. **Evaluate your GenAI application**: Once your repository is fully configured, you can follow the evaluation user flow (*TBD: INSERT LINK WHEN READY*) to evaluate iteratively your application and refine your flows and pipelines.

1. **Deploy your flows**: Once you are happy with your inference prompt flow's performance, you can deploy it to App Service or Azure Machine Learning (AML) endpoint using the CI/CD workflows provided in the AIGA Project repository. More information on making a decision between App Service and AML can be found in the [deployment guide](./deployment.md).

1. **Deploy your Document processing pipelines**: Once you are happy with your document processing pipelines, you can deploy it to Azure Machine Learning (AML) the CI/CD workflows provided in the AIGA Project repository (*TBD: WHEN READY*).

## Personas

The following personas are involved in the AIGA project setup:

1. **Product Manager and Gen AI Engineer**: Use AIGA Reference Architecture to design the product architecture and go through ARB1. Use AIGA Request to request the provisioning of a Code Orange Gen AI Dev Kit and other infrastructure required for the project.

1. **Gen AI Engineer**: Use the AIGA Starter to instantiate a project repository from the AIGA Template.

1. **Data Scientist**: Use the AIGA Project repository (and optionally the RAG Experimentation repository) to experiment, build and industrialise their Gen AI Project.

1. **Product Manager**: Use the project documentation to go through ARB2 during industrialization and supervise MLOps gates into production.

1. **End User**: Use the deployed Gen AI application to evaluate their GenAI application and fine their expectations.
